# Dependency Injection with Attributes

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows you to inject dependencies into a class instead of creating them inside the class. This makes your code more flexible, testable, and maintainable.

## Advantages of Dependency Injection with Attributes

- Better readability and maintainability of the code.
- Dependencies are clearly defined and visible in the code.
- Dependencies can be easily replaced or mocked for testing.
- Dependencies can be automatically resolved by a container.
- Dependencies can be validated at compile time using attributes.
